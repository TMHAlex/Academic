# What is AI ?
* AI 可以說是 Augmented Intelligence，依照專家的資訊及決定，來進行需要費時的工作。
* AI 可以算是一種程序，幫助 machine 用 intelligent ways 來解決問題，並且不需要任何人力來 hard code。

> AI is about augmenting human intelligence by providing information and evidence that subject matter experts need to make informed decisions. AI uses mathematical algorithms to examine examples and create machine learning models based on the inputs and desired outputs.


# Introducing to AI
簡單來說，我們將大數據中的 unstructured data 提供給 machines，這些 data 通常為一些 inputs 和我們希望得到的 outputs ，並且利用一些方式讓 AI 學習辨識。

方式大致上可以分為 :
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

AI 又可以基於 strength, breadth, applications 分為 weak, strong, super AI :

* Weak or Narrow AI
  * Perform specific tasks
  * Make decisions based on programmed algorithms and training data in a specific domain
  * e.g. translators, self-driving cars

* Strong or Generalized AI
  * learn new tasks to solve problems
  * teaching itself new strategies
  * It's the combination of many AI strategies that learn from experience
  * It can perform at a human level of intelligence
  * strong AI doesn’t exist yet
* Super or Conscious AI
  * AI with human-level consciousness.
  * self-aware
  * can't even define what consciousness is now
  * unlikely to be created in the near future

AI 甚至需要非常多學科的知識加入 :
* Psychology
* Linguistics
* Philosophy
  * Provide guidance on ethical considerations

> AI enables computers to understand certain kinds of data that they could not have understood before, such as natural language, auditory and visual data.

# Impact and Examples of AI

AI 根據不同的工作領域，執行不一樣的事情 !

### Chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP)
透過 AI algorithms 我們有辦法和電腦的語音助理對話，這類 Chatbot 用於 :
* 在醫療上用於與病患的溝通、診斷
* 在教育上用於與學生的交流、教學
* 在 Customer service 節省了客服人員的程本

### AI speech-to-text technology
AI 幫助我們能夠更清楚識別並轉化語音為文字，有許多東西受益 :
* Real time transcription
* Speech synthesis
* Regain patient's real voice

### Computer Vision
AI 能比人類更好的識別圖片 ! Computer vision 常常用於 :
* Detecting and labeling objects
* Self-driving cars
* Facial recognition
* Finding symptoms in X-Ray and MRI scans


# Application Domains for AI
1. Collaborative Robots helping humans lift heavy containers
2. Classifying rock samples to identify best places to drill for oil
3. Medical aspects
   * support doctors arrive at more accurate preliminary diagnoses
   * converting the stethoscope into a digital device, then using a machine learning model trained with previous diagnosis results to assist physicians with their current diagnosis
   * by creating massive data sets of information of how people move and how that corresponds to different areas of the brain, AI-powered robots are able to trigger specific movements in the human body which in turn create new neural pathways in the brain
